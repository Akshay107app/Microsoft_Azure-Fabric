# Microsoft Fabric: In-Depth Overview

## What is Microsoft Fabric?
Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics and data platform designed for enterprises that require a unified solution. It encompasses data movement, processing, ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and report building. It offers a comprehensive suite of services including Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Analytics, Data Warehouse, and Databases.

With Fabric, you don't need to assemble different services from multiple vendors. Instead, it offers a seamlessly integrated, user-friendly platform that simplifies your analytics requirements. Operating on a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, Fabric brings simplicity and integration to your solutions.

Microsoft Fabric integrates separate components into a cohesive stack. Instead of relying on different databases or data warehouses, you can centralize data storage with OneLake. AI capabilities are seamlessly embedded within Fabric, eliminating the need for manual integration. With Fabric, you can easily transition your raw data into actionable insights for business users.

## Unification with SaaS foundation:

Microsoft Fabric is built on a foundation of Software as a Service (SaaS). It combines both new and existing components from Power BI, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, and more services into a unified environment. These components are then tailored into customized user experiences.

Fabric integrates workloads such as Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Intelligence, Industry solutions, and Power BI into a shared SaaS foundation. Each of these experiences is tailored for distinct user roles like data engineers, scientists, or warehousing professionals, and they serve a specific task. The entire Fabric stack has AI integration and it accelerates the data journey. These workloads work together seemlessly and provide the following advantages:

Access to an extensive range of deeply integrated analytics in the industry.
Shared experiences across experiences that are familiar and easy to learn.
Easy access to, and readily reuse all assets.
Unified data lake storage that preserves data in its original location while using your preferred analytics tools.
Centralized administration and governance across all experiences.
